Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.\n",

            "  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\n",

            "  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\n",

            "  1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\n",

            "  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.\n",

            "  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\n",

            "  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\n",

            "  1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\n",

            "  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.\n",

Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard..  So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 1.5/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones)Verdict: For this price  Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer  ...\n",

When recording slow motion videos...there is  always flicker on screen.2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue....Suggestions for people who have bought this phone.....Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early...Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone.....If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..\n",

Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.A good to buy phone for  9000\n",

            "  I bought this for 8990.. Now it has reduced to 8399.. The product is worth the price. Before buying make of the purpose of the usage.. This is a budget phone and is not for gaming.. My dad needed a phone which has decent battery life and whatsapp for official usage.. He doesn't use it for anything else... I wanted to buy only Samsung phone. I finally concluded to buy this..Pros.1. Good battery life.2. Size is not big. Hence easy to carry. (This might be a con for few)3. Doesn't heat while charging/ normal usage. Though few have complained of heating. However I didn't experience any heating issue.4. Low sar. (0.61 W/kg- head). I particularly check for SAR value before buying.5. Doesn't heat on normal usage.  This depends on how u define \"Normal\". The apps my dad use are few banking apps, Whatsapp, YouTube, and for office use6. Smooth UI7. Android 10 with latest security update.8. Good call quality. Even after hours of calling it didn't heat up.Cons.Can't complain about these coz you get what u pay for.. Lack of fingerprint scanner and slow charging are to name a few.. Samsung can include a screen guard too. :)However getting a Samsung phone for this price is really worth.. Samsung= Quality & Reliability.Samsung is an innovative brand. They spend lots of money for R&D to bring out new feature. So when I pay for Samsung Iam paying for innovation. :)I will be buying M31 s in next sale.. Samsung 4ever! :)\n",

Guys you should go for Samsung M30 rather than this device... Because they have sold a old phone with new outer body... Phone performance is very low... This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!!You will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ...I recommend you should go for SAMSUNG M21 or SAMSUNG M30 or Samsung M31... They are incredible !!! Samsung phones are long lasting workable ... Phone will not get any problem for 1 to 2 years ... EAST OR WEST ... SAMSUNG IS THE BEST (expect Samsung M11😂) 😋  - Real Fact\n",

Now days  online classes are going on and this phone is a brilliant option.The camera on this price range is the best .It has triple camera setup.Its camera software is loaded with features. We all know how good are Samsung's camera. Face unlock and finger print sensor are way more quick than any other phone.THIS IS THE BUDJET KING.Go for m11.

Supports OTG as well.Cons1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.\n",

            "  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.\n",

            "  I am writing this review after the usage of 15 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.\n",

Please be careful buying any Samsung product as they are operating like a fly-by-night company.I've already spent Rs. 3,000 for a Rs. 6,000 phone without a working phone for the last 1 month.Update on 29 Sep 20.Reducing status to 1 star.The phone is increasingly giving problems.a) The screen responsiveness is getting worse.b)  The SD card is always giving error.c) Taking lots of time to load Apps.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I exchanged my Samsung On5 for Samsung M01 Core mainly because of the lack of internal memory. Good sturdy experience of On5 let me to buy this phone. I have no complaints about the hardware though many of the software have regressed from On5. Let me write them down:1. Samsung On5 running on Android 6 was more stable than current Android 10. It has rebooted atleast twice on it's own.2. Camera has no panorama and other mode which was there in On5.3. Chrome hanged twice during this period.4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.6. Unread SMS not highlighted.Go version shouldn't mean regression. I'll be happy to discuss with the architects who would want genuine op\n",

Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.\n",

            "  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.\n",

Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.\n",

Please be careful buying any Samsung product as they are operating like a fly-by-night company.I've already spent Rs. 3,000 for a Rs. 6,000 phone without a working phone for the last 1 month.Update on 29 Sep 20.Reducing status to 1 star.The phone is increasingly giving problems.a) The screen responsiveness is getting worse.b)  The SD card is always giving error.c) Taking lots of time to load Apps.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I exchanged my Samsung On5 for Samsung M01 Core mainly because of the lack of internal memory. Good sturdy experience of On5 let me to buy this phone. I have no complaints about the hardware though many of the software have regressed from On5. Let me write them down:1. Samsung On5 running on Android 6 was more stable than current Android 10. It has rebooted atleast twice on it's own.2. Camera has no panorama and other mode which was there in On5.3. Chrome hanged twice during this period.4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.6. Unread SMS not highlighted.Go version shouldn't mean regression. I'll be happy to discuss with the architects who would want genuine op\n",

Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.\n",

            "  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.\n",

Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.\n",

Please be careful buying any Samsung product as they are operating like a fly-by-night company.I've already spent Rs. 3,000 for a Rs. 6,000 phone without a working phone for the last 1 month.Update on 29 Sep 20.Reducing status to 1 star.The phone is increasingly giving problems.a) The screen responsiveness is getting worse.b)  The SD card is always giving error.c) Taking lots of time to load Apps.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I exchanged my Samsung On5 for Samsung M01 Core mainly because of the lack of internal memory. Good sturdy experience of On5 let me to buy this phone. I have no complaints about the hardware though many of the software have regressed from On5. Let me write them down:1. Samsung On5 running on Android 6 was more stable than current Android 10. It has rebooted atleast twice on it's own.2. Camera has no panorama and other mode which was there in On5.3. Chrome hanged twice during this period.4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.6. Unread SMS not highlighted.Go version shouldn't mean regression. I'll be happy to discuss with the architects who would want genuine op\n",

            "  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\n",

            "  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\n",

            "  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is \"dust\" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.\n",

PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\n",

            "  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.\n",

Supports OTG as well.Cons1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.\n",

            "  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.\n",

            "  I am writing this review after the usage of 15 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues. Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.\n",

            "  I have recieved this phone on 14th of August 2020 and today is 24th of August 2020.So After 10 Days i am reviewing this phone because i have seen many negative reviews on amazon review portal so now my true experience is about this phone following.1:- Processor Media tek Quad core Is best because quad core take less power from battry than the octa core processor. and i purchased this phone for my mom so quad core porcessor is sufficient to my mom.2:- Battry life is good because of Quad Core Processor.3:- Ram is 2Gb that is also sufficient4:- Display as always awesome as samsung provide.5:- Mike and Speaker's quality is too good as always samsung provide.6:- Many People said in the review that the mobile is automatically swiched off and on automatically. yes i have seen this my own only one time. but its not the problem. every new phone have done this one time because of system works smoothly. and after one time switch off on things happen then never repeated till my 10 days of use this phone. so you people who is taking switch off on problem very seriously ,you should not. this is one time process when phone is new sometimes phone may swich off and on automatically. so dont panik at all for this.7:- most of the people want to replace the phone because of one time switch off on problem then i have to say one thing that your first phone is the only phone who is brand new and the replaced phone never be a new phone at all . so never replace your new phone. this is my own experience.8:- I am fully satisfied from this phone in this price of 6499.9:-This is all the reason that is why i am giving 5 star this phone.Thank U Samsung.\n",

Please be careful buying any Samsung product as they are operating like a fly-by-night company.I've already spent Rs. 3,000 for a Rs. 6,000 phone without a working phone for the last 1 month.Update on 29 Sep 20.Reducing status to 1 star.The phone is increasingly giving problems.a) The screen responsiveness is getting worse.b)  The SD card is always giving error.c) Taking lots of time to load Apps.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I exchanged my Samsung On5 for Samsung M01 Core mainly because of the lack of internal memory. Good sturdy experience of On5 let me to buy this phone. I have no complaints about the hardware though many of the software have regressed from On5. Let me write them down:1. Samsung On5 running on Android 6 was more stable than current Android 10. It has rebooted atleast twice on it's own.2. Camera has no panorama and other mode which was there in On5.3. Chrome hanged twice during this period.4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.6. Unread SMS not highlighted.Go version shouldn't mean regression. I'll be happy to discuss with the architects who would want genuine op\n",

Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\n",

            "  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\n",

            "  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is \"dust\" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.\n",

PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\n",

            "  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.\n",

Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.A good to buy phone for  9000\n",

            "  I bought this for 8990.. Now it has reduced to 8399.. The product is worth the price. Before buying make of the purpose of the usage.. This is a budget phone and is not for gaming.. My dad needed a phone which has decent battery life and whatsapp for official usage.. He doesn't use it for anything else... I wanted to buy only Samsung phone. I finally concluded to buy this..Pros.1. Good battery life.2. Size is not big. Hence easy to carry. (This might be a con for few)3. Doesn't heat while charging/ normal usage. Though few have complained of heating. However I didn't experience any heating issue.4. Low sar. (0.61 W/kg- head). I particularly check for SAR value before buying.5. Doesn't heat on normal usage.  This depends on how u define \"Normal\". The apps my dad use are few banking apps, Whatsapp, YouTube, and for office use6. Smooth UI7. Android 10 with latest security update.8. Good call quality. Even after hours of calling it didn't heat up.Cons.Can't complain about these coz you get what u pay for.. Lack of fingerprint scanner and slow charging are to name a few.. Samsung can include a screen guard too. :)However getting a Samsung phone for this price is really worth.. Samsung= Quality & Reliability.Samsung is an innovative brand. They spend lots of money for R&D to bring out new feature. So when I pay for Samsung Iam paying for innovation. :)I will be buying M31 s in next sale.. Samsung 4ever! :)\n",

            "  At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.\n",

            "  Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage\n",

            "  There's something wrong with the new Samsung M51 mobile. Many other users are also facing the same issue. We are unable to connect through Wi-Fi on Samsung M51.Meanest Monster Ever ... HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says \"Incorrect Password\".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue.\n",

            "  I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average\n",

Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.\n",

            "  Usually I don't write the reviews, but this time I couldn't resist myself from doing so.First of all, I am a Samsung hater, but my wife didn't want a chinese brand phone, so I had no option than to go with Samsung. Therefore, this review may look like bias, but believe me, it's not.Doesn't look like a 27K phone. Screen looks so dull compared to my 3 years old one plus 5t phone. UI is boring. Stock android would have been appreciated. 3 finger screenshot feature is not available (though there are other ways, this one is easiest). Out of 8Gb 3.2Gb RAM was showing as used out of the box. Out of 128Gb , 32Gb was showing as used. Neither of the camera was impressive. There are some default apps (bloatware) which are absolutely useless. They didn't even provide the silicon transparent cover with the phone. The only good thing about this phone is - it is very bulky (this is not the sarcasm, I really like bulky phones)Anyway, I won't be using this phone, but feeling very bad that I spent this much of money for such a cheap phone 😥\n",

Don't fall into the trap of extensive hype of a product2. Don't believe youtubers reviews just before experiencing atleast 30 days of usage.3. Don't buy a product on its first day of launch4.

Night mode could have been better.3. Sound: Speakers: Better than average, earphones: good4. Battery: Very good. But expected more backup from a 7000 mah battery. Had to charge it once a day for the last 4 days.5. UI: The one-ui provided here is different from the one provided in A series. The one that comes with A series phones like A50 etc is more user friendly and has more features like Secure folder, timer etc. Also, the Samsung notes app in A series is far better than the one provided here. In this price, an UI at par with the leading A series phones is expected.6. Processor: Good for normal use.7. Finger print unlock is fast and smooth.8. No case/ back cover and no earphone.9. A bit overpriced.\n",

            "  First impressions: the celestial black colour looks really good and elegant. Looks better than in pics or videos. The phone feels solid in hand. The screen is large and great quality punchy colors. The screen is also very bright.Performance too seems good except that the real performance will be known a while later as Samsung mobile tend to slow down with time. The back is a fingerprint magnet, so a case is a must.The battery is really a beast and charger is decent too. Battery easily lasts 2 days with average use, even with heavy use it lasts one and a half days.Camera Performance is great at this price. The pictures and videos come out great.I got the 6gb variant with hdfc offer and with HDFC smart buy, the price should come down to 22000. Its a great phone at this price. Most of the cons mentioned in online reviews are not for me. I am happy with this phone.Why I preferred M51 over Nord? M51 ticks all the right boxes for me. A great screen for watching videos, good casual gaming, a great battery lasting at least 2 days, a better camera, 128 gb storage with microsd card support  and at a price which is Rs. 3000  cheaper. I already have Samsung and Oneplus phones at home. So I can say with confidence that you won't go wrong with any of the brand.My overall first impression is that its a great phone with almost all things that one may need at this price. Will keep updating.\n",

Supports OTG as well.Cons1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.\n",

            "  After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.\n",

Me and my friend both purchased the same phone for our aunts and are facing the same issues. The main issue I am facing is that the phone switched off 2 days back and since then I am trying to switch it on but its leading me nowhere. Neither it is charging. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then... All we both are able to do is to regret on wastage of our money.\n",

Please be careful buying any Samsung product as they are operating like a fly-by-night company.I've already spent Rs. 3,000 for a Rs. 6,000 phone without a working phone for the last 1 month.Update on 29 Sep 20.Reducing status to 1 star.The phone is increasingly giving problems.a) The screen responsiveness is getting worse.b)  The SD card is always giving error.c) Taking lots of time to load Apps.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I exchanged my Samsung On5 for Samsung M01 Core mainly because of the lack of internal memory. Good sturdy experience of On5 let me to buy this phone. I have no complaints about the hardware though many of the software have regressed from On5. Let me write them down:1. Samsung On5 running on Android 6 was more stable than current Android 10. It has rebooted atleast twice on it's own.2. Camera has no panorama and other mode which was there in On5.3. Chrome hanged twice during this period.4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.6. Unread SMS not highlighted.Go version shouldn't mean regression. I'll be happy to discuss with the architects who would want genuine op\n",

Also the screen refresh rate is low so video and game quality is not very good. How much money Samsung saved by cost cuttings ? May be 1000 rs. Not worth losing the market share to chinese brands. Samsung should start giving customers value for their money or else they will end up like Nokia, Sony and Toshiba.\n",

The display is extremely good, better than its competitors at this price. Now coming to its performance, it's quite good. I didn't found any slowness while using it. The battery is running for 2-3 days on normal use.One thing which I saw missing is missed call, message or notification indicator which most of its competitors have.Those who are looking for a phone below 10k and use their phones moderately can consider this one.\n",

I felt its a bit slower than my 3.5 years old 'totally broken' Redmi note 4. Cameras are average. Adding to the list of flaws, micro phone is not working properly with WhatsApp and Telegram. Voice messages are so quiet most of the times.There is no return and refund policy, only replacement possible. So please don't buy it. Waste of money.

            "  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.\n",

            "  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.\n",

Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider\n",

Canera - Excellent camera - Good low light photography.  64 Megapixel does uts wor. Inteli Cam is just awesome.2. Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent.Touch is just Excellent.3. Phone looks really cool in hands.4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have.5. UI is good.6. Speaker sound is good.7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim.Overall its very nice experience using this phone.I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice.Cons -1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery.I was hoping to get little more backup2. Processor  - Could have been better3  No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market\n",

            "  This is my personal view n review.  I upgraded from ayear old Redmi note 7 pro to M31 s because i wanted a non Chinese phone & m31s promo claimed good camera  battery etc. After usage of a week, I am sure that this was a bad decision. This phone is overhyped n priced. 15k would have been the right price for it. Its camera is good but doesn't give you out of the world experience.  Battery is 6K but doesnt run even for 1.5 day under normal use. Plastic used on backcover is cheap, the Samsung chipset sucks, this phone should have come with snapdragon and in range of 15K. I am not liking to write this review but Samsung has disappointed again. Redmi or one plus phones are clear winners. I will return this phone.\n",

            "  Hi all,From Samsung M31s.Bought it on Amazon Prime day sale. Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India.Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC's 10% discount.But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn't come with the box and also wasn't available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5\")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn't have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn't have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔Handle with care.\n",

            "  I am writing this review after 3 days of moderate to heavy usage.Design: The design of the phone is stunning even though its made of glasstic. The back is a dust and fingerprint magnet. So suggest to use a case. 5/5.Battery: Monstrous. Lasted for a day after watching 2 movies, occasional checking of mails, light gaming and browsing social media. I still had 10% left. The highlight is of course reverse charging and the super fast charging support. Took around 100 to 120 mins to charge the phone completely from 0 to 100. 5/5.Camera: One of the best if not the best camera in this range. The Sony sensor does a great job in the imaging department with some intelli cam features. 4.5/5.Processor and UI: For the last 3 days, that I've been using this phone, UI was pretty smooth and with some bloatware. I am a stock android lover, so thankfully I was able to delete a few pre-installed apps and block the ads/app recommendations while setting up the phone. There are some cool features like smart pop up view which are really awesome. The processor was lag free and its performance was smooth. I don't want to comment on gaming as I am not a heavy gamer. Overall an great choice for day to day usage. 4.5/5.Display: No comments. Just 5/5.The only disappointment I had was there was no case provided in the box. Overall I would give 5/5 for this phone. Regarding the pricing, when I've compared it with the competitors for 6/128 gb variants there was a difference of 1k to 1500 which I felt was fine considering the Samsung brand and features offered.I would recommend this one if anyone is looking for a decent phone under 20k.\n",

            "  At first glance it looks a bit bulky. Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.\n",

            "  Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage\n",

HahahahaThis meanest monster is performing poorly within 5 min of unboxing. My eight yr old Lenovo still works like charm with Wi-Fi.Issue: When you trying connecting through Wi-Fi, on giving correct password, it says \"Incorrect Password\".I have done every troubleshooting step suggested by Samsung Tech support:1. Forget the connection and reconnect again.2. Update the phone s/w to latest version.3. Reset Settings4. Reset Network Settings5. Factory Data ResetI have applied every step suggested by tech-support and the result is still the same.The most irritating thing is how can a company like Samsung mess-up such a basic feature & to the surprise, even the tech support has now run out of troubleshooting solutions.Instead of replacing it with new phone, tech support has now told me to get the hardware fixed from Samsung Service centre. I don't get it why should I take a brand new phone to service center & get it opened. Instead a replacement of this phone should be there, I have not even used it for more than an hour.Last year I ordered an MI phone from Flipkart, the battery was getting drained very fast. Within the next day, the phone was replaced without questions asked.Dissappointed by Amazon, the way they are handling this issue.Don't spend your hard-earned money on this phone. Unfortunately, if your phone turns-out to be faulty, then there is a never ending process to take care of issue.\n",

            "  I am giving this review after spending 20 days with this Phone. I am a retail user and after 6 year of redmi and realme user now buy the Samsung just because of Samsung+Snapdragon and very much dispointed. Here are some Pros and Cons which will help other user like me to decide whether they will buy it or not.Cons :1. No Haptic Feedback2. Low sound quality speaker at Rs 25K3. No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2. Camera quality Good3. 7000 Mah battery4. Till now Ram management is goodTo much hype created every where for this phone and due to this many user like me has purchased this phone but this phone under 25k is really not value for money. I am going to resale this phone. There are so many phone below 25k with best facilities as compare to this Samsung m51.Conclusion : Phone is overpriced and performance is average\n",

Now in M51 feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. 6.7 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.\n",

            "  Usually I don't write the reviews, but this time I couldn't resist myself from doing so.First of all, I am a Samsung hater, but my wife didn't want a chinese brand phone, so I had no option than to go with Samsung. Therefore, this review may look like bias, but believe me, it's not.Doesn't look like a 27K phone. Screen looks so dull compared to my 3 years old one plus 5t phone. UI is boring. Stock android would have been appreciated. 3 finger screenshot feature is not available (though there are other ways, this one is easiest). Out of 8Gb 3.2Gb RAM was showing as used out of the box. Out of 128Gb , 32Gb was showing as used. Neither of the camera was impressive. There are some default apps (bloatware) which are absolutely useless. They didn't even provide the silicon transparent cover with the phone. The only good thing about this phone is - it is very bulky (this is not the sarcasm, I really like bulky phones)Anyway, I won't be using this phone, but feeling very bad that I spent this much of money for such a cheap phone 😥\n",

Don't fall into the trap of extensive hype of a product2. Don't believe youtubers reviews just before experiencing atleast 30 days of usage.3. Don't buy a product on its first day of launch4.

Night mode could have been better.3. Sound: Speakers: Better than average, earphones: good4. Battery: Very good. But expected more backup from a 7000 mah battery. Had to charge it once a day for the last 4 days.5. UI: The one-ui provided here is different from the one provided in A series. The one that comes with A series phones like A50 etc is more user friendly and has more features like Secure folder, timer etc. Also, the Samsung notes app in A series is far better than the one provided here. In this price, an UI at par with the leading A series phones is expected.6. Processor: Good for normal use.7. Finger print unlock is fast and smooth.8. No case/ back cover and no earphone.9. A bit overpriced.\n",

            "  First impressions: the celestial black colour looks really good and elegant. Looks better than in pics or videos. The phone feels solid in hand. The screen is large and great quality punchy colors. The screen is also very bright.Performance too seems good except that the real performance will be known a while later as Samsung mobile tend to slow down with time. The back is a fingerprint magnet, so a case is a must.The battery is really a beast and charger is decent too. Battery easily lasts 2 days with average use, even with heavy use it lasts one and a half days.Camera Performance is great at this price. The pictures and videos come out great.I got the 6gb variant with hdfc offer and with HDFC smart buy, the price should come down to 22000. Its a great phone at this price. Most of the cons mentioned in online reviews are not for me. I am happy with this phone.Why I preferred M51 over Nord? M51 ticks all the right boxes for me. A great screen for watching videos, good casual gaming, a great battery lasting at least 2 days, a better camera, 128 gb storage with microsd card support  and at a price which is Rs. 3000  cheaper. I already have Samsung and Oneplus phones at home. So I can say with confidence that you won't go wrong with any of the brand.My overall first impression is that its a great phone with almost all things that one may need at this price. Will keep updating.\n",

Sound of speaker and microphone is clear and loud.Network catching capability is high. Buy it guys if your budget is 10k. You can't get this type of smartphone in this range.And also if has Dolby sound. Listen music with your earphone will refresh your mood.Charging time 2.30hrs. But it is not for high end games. If you dont play 1GB size game, then go for this masterpiece. You will not regret.\n",

Also the screen refresh rate is low so video and game quality is not very good. How much money Samsung saved by cost cuttings ? May be 1000 rs. Not worth losing the market share to chinese brands. Samsung should start giving customers value for their money or else they will end up like Nokia, Sony and Toshiba.\n",

The display is extremely good, better than its competitors at this price. Now coming to its performance, it's quite good. I didn't found any slowness while using it. The battery is running for 2-3 days on normal use.One thing which I saw missing is missed call, message or notification indicator which most of its competitors have.Those who are looking for a phone below 10k and use their phones moderately can consider this one.\n",

This one says it has 4000 mah battery but only gives less than 7hrs of screentime (that too in normal use WhatsApp and Chrome etc)Heating issue is there. I felt its a bit slower than my 3.5 years old 'totally broken' Redmi note 4. Cameras are average. Adding to the list of flaws, micro phone is not working properly with WhatsApp and Telegram. Voice messages are so quiet most of the times.There is no return and refund policy, only replacement possible. So please don't buy it. Waste of money.

            "  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\n",

            "  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\n",

            "  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is \"dust\" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.\n",

PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\n",

            "  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.\n",

Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutesSpeaker volume low.The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls.Pros:Feels lightweightNice display.The camera is decent.Update 1:Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer.Update 2:Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit.\n",

            "  This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\n",

            "  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\n",

            "  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is \"dust\" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.\n",

PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\n",

            "  HiI am using M31 Since 6/3/2020.Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31.1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.\n",

Guys you should go for Samsung M30 rather than this device... Because they have sold a old phone with new outer body... Phone performance is very low... This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!!You will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ...I recommend you should go for SAMSUNG M21 or SAMSUNG M30 or Samsung M31... They are incredible !!! Samsung phones are long lasting workable ... Phone will not get any problem for 1 to 2 years ... EAST OR WEST ... SAMSUNG IS THE BEST (expect Samsung M11😂) 😋  - Real Fact\n",

Now days  online classes are going on and this phone is a brilliant option.The camera on this price range is the best .It has triple camera setup.Its camera software is loaded with features. We all know how good are Samsung's camera. Face unlock and finger print sensor are way more quick than any other phone.THIS IS THE BUDJET KING.Go for m11.

            "  Samsung Metro 313 is a cute handset but Samsung has not followed software ergonomics. There is no shortcut to Silent/Vibration mode nor the LED Torchlight which are very much essential. Also, the built-in FM Radio is not Wireless FM. Moreover, there is a slight lag in processing power. However, handset has a good hand-feel. If you are looking out for instant Silent/Vibration Mode, LED Torchlight and/or Wireless FM, this handset is not for you. However, if you are looking out for a cute little handset with a good hand-feel, this handset will not disappoint you. Go get one!\n",

The sound quality is above average, though not perfect. Battery back up is the most attractive thing. Even after 10 days, it is showing about 80% charge. This may be due to the low usage. A small and handy set, easy to carry around. The price is a bit higher than my expectation, but considering the positive factors, I don't think it is too high. Overall, it is a nice product. I am giving only 4 stars because I have used it only for a few days. After a few months of usage I may revise it.\n",

This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!!You will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ...I recommend you should go for SAMSUNG M21 or SAMSUNG M30 or Samsung M31... They are incredible !!! Samsung phones are long lasting workable ... Phone will not get any problem for 1 to 2 years ... EAST OR WEST ... SAMSUNG IS THE BEST (expect Samsung M11😂) 😋  - Real Fact\n",

Now days  online classes are going on and this phone is a brilliant option.The camera on this price range is the best .It has triple camera setup.Its camera software is loaded with features. We all know how good are Samsung's camera. Face unlock and finger print sensor are way more quick than any other phone.THIS IS THE BUDJET KING.Go for m11. You will surely enjoy the experience of m11.\n",

HONEST PERFORMANCE. HONEST PRICE.', 'Reviewed in India on 10 August 2020', 'Colour: Mirage BlackStyle name: 6GB RAM', \"  Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it.

Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.\", '1,080 people found this helpful'], 'AEMLJ6CN2KRHLH55FQ2X7J2EISPQ': ['Sneha Jaiswal Singla', '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'The phone got dead just after the initial setup', 'Reviewed in India on 10 August 2020', 'Colour: Mirage BlackStyle name: 6GB RAM', '  \\xa0This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung.

Kudos Amazon India.Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC\\'s 10% discount.But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn\\'t come with the box and also wasn\\'t available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5\")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn\\'t have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing.

Lasted for a day after watching 2 movies, occasional checking of mails, light gaming and browsing social media. I still had 10% left. The highlight is of course reverse charging and the super fast charging support. Took around 100 to 120 mins to charge the phone completely from 0 to 100. 5/5.Camera: One of the best if not the best camera in this range. The Sony sensor does a great job in the imaging department with some intelli cam features. 4.5/5.Processor and UI: For the last 3 days, that I've been using this phone, UI was pretty smooth and with some bloatware. I am a stock android lover, so thankfully I was able to delete a few pre-installed apps and block the ads/app recommendations while setting up the phone. There are some cool features like smart pop up view which are really awesome. The processor was lag free and its performance was smooth. I don't want to comment on gaming as I am not a heavy gamer. Overall an great choice for day to day usage. 4.5/5.Display: No comments. Just 5/5.The only disappointment I had was there was no case provided in the box. Overall I would give 5/5 for this phone. Regarding the pricing, when I've compared it with the competitors for 6/128 gb variants there was a difference of 1k to 1500 which I felt was fine considering the Samsung brand and features offered.I would recommend this one if anyone is looking for a decent phone under 20k.\", '77 people found this helpful'], 'AHLSLAP4CJGJBVPAAROVT6NCD3KA': ['Priyanka', '1.0 out of 5 stars', \"As per price it's worst phone//Please don't buy this worst phone.\", 'Reviewed in India on 15 August 2020', 'Colour: Mirage BlueStyle name: 8GB RAM', \"  There is too much problem in this phone.1.  6000Mah battery but phone doesn't work even half day on standby mode.2.

The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong!

First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\", '238 people found this helpful'], 'AGTVT5A2TF5BCOJORFLXPGIF3A6Q': ['R.

I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it.

This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say.

Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn\\'t have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom.

So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 1.5/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low..

I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it.

Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say.

Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5\")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn\\'t have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn\\'t have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔Handle with care.', '161 people found this helpful'], 'AFLCQLJWUNC4TV4FM73K6CCNHNCQ': ['Ayon', '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Overheating issue', 'Reviewed in India on 14 August 2020', 'Colour: Mirage BlueStyle name: 6GB RAM', '  Upper portion of the phone is getting heated after using it for very short period.....and even when making a call for 2-3 minutes same thing is being experienced.....but lower portion of the phnoe seems fine...also called Amazon technical support to check about this....they checked my phone through servify app...told me all are ok....if anyone facing same thing....please let me know....is it a common issue?', '153 people found this helpful'], 'AHFXAI2AWWBGQDNOV2HA5LIR7WKA': ['Vicky Denge', '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'M31s -- Superb !!', 'Reviewed in India on 10 August 2020', 'Colour: Mirage BlueStyle name: 8GB RAM', '  Pros :1.

Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\", '3,792 people found this helpful'], 'AE7Y67QXAWXX5NAUHYWQRILF4ZGQ': ['shailesh', '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Samsung m31 all rounder  best mobile.', 'Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020', 'Size name: 6GB RAM, 64GB StorageStyle name: Normal EditionColour: Ocean Blue', '  Best camera, very good battery life, eat body material, average weight, best performance,  best display.', '2,531 people found this helpful'], 'AGSTQVXJ2JKYARIRNXORWWOJE3KQ': ['surojit das', '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Poor camera', 'Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020', 'Size name: 6GB RAM, 64GB StorageStyle name: Normal EditionColour: Ocean Blue', '  3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera.

My dad needed a phone which has decent battery life and whatsapp for official usage.. He doesn\\'t use it for anything else... I wanted to buy only Samsung phone. I finally concluded to buy this..Pros.1. Good battery life.2. Size is not big. Hence easy to carry. (This might be a con for few)3. Doesn\\'t heat while charging/ normal usage. Though few have complained of heating. However I didn\\'t experience any heating issue.4. Low sar. (0.61 W/kg- head). I particularly check for SAR value before buying.5. Doesn\\'t heat on normal usage.  This depends on how u define \"Normal\". The apps my dad use are few banking apps, Whatsapp, YouTube, and for office use6. Smooth UI7. Android 10 with latest security update.8. Good call quality. Even after hours of calling it didn\\'t heat up.Cons.Can\\'t complain about these coz you get what u pay for.. Lack of fingerprint scanner and slow charging are to name a few.. Samsung can include a screen guard too. :)However getting a Samsung phone for this price is really worth..

Chrome hanged twice during this period.4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.6. Unread SMS not highlighted.Go version shouldn't mean regression.

My friend also faced the phone off issue but it was resolved automatically after 2 days when he connected a fast carger to the phone. He is too facing the heating issue. His phone still switches off on its own again and again now and then...

Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use.

The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet.

Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8.

Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone.

Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use.

The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong!

PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\", '238 people found this helpful'], 'AGTVT5A2TF5BCOJORFLXPGIF3A6Q': ['R.

Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit.

Camera, display etc. are satisfactory.

You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.\", '1,282 people found this helpful'], 'AGQ2VHUW32YF4XSYYEODFVUUJPSA': ['Arghyajyoti Pramanik', '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Best Smart Phone under 25000/-', 'Reviewed in India on 21 September 2020', 'Colour: Electric BlueStyle name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage', '  Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....Super clear ZoomSuper Macro sensorSuper ultrawide angleAtlast Thanks Samsung for 730G', '943 people found this helpful'], 'AHM6RVA25MYK24MNXABZLRVNNP3A': ['Sanjeev Kumar', '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Not recommend, if you want waste your  money  then purchase', 'Reviewed in India on 21 September 2020', 'Colour: Electric BlueStyle name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage', '  Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000.

I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage', '232 people found this helpful'], 'AF27II3QK5FTRUT2P52A4JC6K2IA': ['ishan gautam', '1.0 out of 5 stars', \"Don't buy this product.

The back is a fingerprint magnet, so a case is a must.The battery is really a beast and charger is decent too.

The pictures and videos come out great.I got the 6gb variant with hdfc offer and with HDFC smart buy, the price should come down to 22000. Its a great phone at this price.

I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it.

Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say.

Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn\\'t have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom.

The back is a dust and fingerprint magnet. So suggest to use a case. 5/5.Battery: Monstrous. Lasted for a day after watching 2 movies, occasional checking of mails, light gaming and browsing social media. I still had 10% left. The highlight is of course reverse charging and the super fast charging support. Took around 100 to 120 mins to charge the phone completely from 0 to 100. 5/5.Camera: One of the best if not the best camera in this range. The Sony sensor does a great job in the imaging department with some intelli cam features. 4.5/5.Processor and UI: For the last 3 days, that I've been using this phone, UI was pretty smooth and with some bloatware. I am a stock android lover, so thankfully I was able to delete a few pre-installed apps and block the ads/app recommendations while setting up the phone. There are some cool features like smart pop up view which are really awesome. The processor was lag free and its performance was smooth. I don't want to comment on gaming as I am not a heavy gamer. Overall an great choice for day to day usage. 4.5/5.Display: No comments. Just 5/5.The only disappointment I had was there was no case provided in the box. Overall I would give 5/5 for this phone. Regarding the pricing, when I've compared it with the competitors for 6/128 gb variants there was a difference of 1k to 1500 which I felt was fine considering the Samsung brand and features offered.I would recommend this one if anyone is looking for a decent phone under 20k.\", '77 people found this helpful'], 'AHLSLAP4CJGJBVPAAROVT6NCD3KA': ['Priyanka', '1.0 out of 5 stars', \"As per price it's worst phone//Please don't buy this worst phone.\", 'Reviewed in India on 15 August 2020', 'Colour: Mirage BlueStyle name: 8GB RAM', \"  There is too much problem in this phone.1.  6000Mah battery but phone doesn't work even half day on standby mode.2.

Camera, display etc. are satisfactory. Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.\", '1,282 people found this helpful'], 'AGQ2VHUW32YF4XSYYEODFVUUJPSA': ['Arghyajyoti Pramanik', '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Best Smart Phone under 25000/-', 'Reviewed in India on 21 September 2020', 'Colour: Electric BlueStyle name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage', '  Awesome camera Awesome battery Awesome display  ....Super clear ZoomSuper Macro sensorSuper ultrawide angleAtlast Thanks Samsung for 730G', '943 people found this helpful'], 'AHM6RVA25MYK24MNXABZLRVNNP3A': ['Sanjeev Kumar', '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Not recommend, if you want waste your  money  then purchase', 'Reviewed in India on 21 September 2020', 'Colour: Electric BlueStyle name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage', '  Cons:_OverpricedBattery drain only fast in normal  uses give only  24 hours  backup.Sound quality  is so soBuild quality  is not goodPros:_Good processorGood  cameraUser interface  is goodFinger print sensor  working  very fast but some times missed out.After six days of uses, impressed  with camera performance, Display, fingerprint  working, and processor.Disappointed  with Battery  performance  my brother  realme 2 giving easily 2days battery  backup with 4250mah, but this phone is horrible in battery  backup  only  24 hours  with 7000.

Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage', '232 people found this helpful'], 'AF27II3QK5FTRUT2P52A4JC6K2IA': ['ishan gautam', '1.0 out of 5 stars', \"Don't buy this product.

No apps lock features inbuilt4. No Case Cover in Box5. Plain Plastic back design at 25K which attract too much scratches.6. Samsung trusted Knox security not fully enable on this phone i.e no secure folder option.7. When Sealed Package open then phone display contain so much dust. Not expected the packaging like this from brand like Samsung.8. Gorila Glass 3 protection under 25k i.e out dated glass protection after using 2 days with full care i got one scratch mark on display.9. NFC given but Samsung Pay not there in this phone.10. Audio output in my boat rockers bluetooth headset with this phone is not as much as lound as compare to my previous phone Redmi Note 7 pro.11. Without using phone it take 2 hour to charge but when you use it frequently then it take 2.30-3 hour to charged it full from 0-100%.12. Full battery drained in 12 hour with non stop used including youtube, whatsapp Facebook, messaging, etc except game.13. No Carrier aggregation: Using Jio sim in Samsung M51 and realme X2 pro and both contain different net speed in which Samsung giving me 5mbps and realme x2 pro giving me 9-10mbps.14. Calling issue: while talking through ear piece on call, the person can hear my voice clearly. But if i put the call on loudspeaker, the receiver of call cant hear my voice or he hear my sound very low. Turning back to earpiece the person is able to hear me again.15. Camera Zoom quality is not good. When you focus on Sky whole pic turn into blue. i.e saturation level is too much high in this phone (Image attached).16. While watching movie video in this phone or playing video in youtube brightness fluctuate fast too much automatically i.e Adaptive Brightness issue.Pros :1. Super amoled plus display2.

The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3.

For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi.

The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5.

First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\", '3,792 people found this helpful'], 'AE7Y67QXAWXX5NAUHYWQRILF4ZGQ': ['shailesh', '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Samsung m31 all rounder  best mobile.', 'Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020', 'Size name: 6GB RAM, 64GB StorageStyle name: Normal EditionColour: Ocean Blue', '  Best camera, very good battery life, eat body material, average weight, best performance,  best display.', '2,531 people found this helpful'], 'AGSTQVXJ2JKYARIRNXORWWOJE3KQ': ['surojit das', '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'Poor camera', 'Reviewed in India on 9 March 2020', 'Size name: 6GB RAM, 64GB StorageStyle name: Normal EditionColour: Ocean Blue', '  3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera.

This phone\\'s quality doesn\\'t meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3.

We need to give thumb impressions  twice or thrice to open.After call ends when we remove mobile from our ear immediately  sensor doesn't  recognize.  We need to press lock button then only light comes on display.This is irritating for regular user. This issue should be resolved by Samsung.There is no replacement  also.\", '8 people found this helpful'], 'AHV27TLEDLUPKJEHI5EAW2QXFUXA': ['Pooran singh bisht', '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Airphone missing', 'Reviewed in India on 24 June 2020', 'Colour: Metallic BlueSize name: 3GB+32GBStyle name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers', '  At the time of booking, there was showing a airphone inside the box but when we have open the box there was no any air phone in this box it means this item was missing.', '9 people found this helpful'], 'AHCTX4X3MDCUHEQUV7GZF5DBYWMQ': ['Ansh', '2.0 out of 5 stars', 'Better to go with Galaxy m21', 'Reviewed in India on 18 July 2020', 'Colour: Metallic BlueSize name: 3GB+32GBStyle name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers', '  Yeah, you can go for this Galaxy m11 but it will be better to go with the Galaxy m21(If you are going to buy 4Gb, 64Gb storage of Galaxy m11) as it contains enhanced processor, RAM, Camera, and pretty much everything. The reason why I am saying this because Samsung is demanding more money for budget phones. I have purchased Galaxy A10 for Rs. 7500 and it is far better than Galaxy M11.', '7 people found this helpful'], 'AEZCVGNBZ35LJX5HSI46XRJIWZOQ': ['Roop kumar', '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'Best phone for regular users.', 'Reviewed in India on 18 September 2020', 'Colour: Metallic BlueSize name: 3GB+32GBStyle name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers', \"  If someone is interested in a phone that can be in budget and also has huge screen with great picture quality and with a massive battery of 2 days must go for it.This phone can be used to play games at low settings but heavy tittles get little bit laggy....this may be due to mid tear snapdragon processor 450.But if you are a student then it is the best phone you can get under 11000.The most important thing is its screen and battery .Massive 5000 mah battery with lasted 2 days for me on full charge.....the sound is also loud .It is good for multimedia and YouTube. Now days  online classes are going on and this phone is a brilliant option.The camera on this price range is the best .It has triple camera setup.Its camera software is loaded with features. We all know how good are Samsung's camera. Face unlock and finger print sensor are way more quick than any other phone.THIS IS THE BUDJET KING.Go for m11.
